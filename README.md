# Usnjrnl Rewind / USN full path builder

For an explanation of Usnjrnl Rewind, read the blog post [here](https://cybercx.com.au/blog/nfts-usnjrnl-rewind/)).

This script will process the outputs of Eric Zimmerman's MFTEcmd tool and produce a csv that has the complete and correct path for every file and folder (no more Unknowns). 

It uses a different method to compute the full paths, essentially by _rewinding_ the journal and keeping track of all  changes as they occur going from the last entry in the journal to the first. 

_If your journal has no gaps (under normal circumstances there should not be any), then there should be no unknown paths in the output._

### Usage
```
$ python3 usnjrnl_rewind.py â€“h

usage: usnjrnl_rewind.py [-h] [-m MFT_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE] [-u USNJRNL_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE] output_path

USN full path builder v0.4

positional arguments:
  output_path           Output folder path (will create if non-existent)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MFT_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE, --mft_processed_csv_file MFT_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE
                        processed $MFT csv from MFTECMD (required)
  -u USNJRNL_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE, --usnjrnl_processed_csv_file USNJRNL_PROCESSED_CSV_FILE
                        processed $Usnjrnl:$J csv from MFTECMD (required)

This tool needs the output of Mftecmd for both USN and MFT 
(no need to process both together when processing the USN in mftecmd)
```

### Sample output
```
% python3 usnjrnl_rewind.py -m mftv3.csv -u usnv3.csv rewind_out
